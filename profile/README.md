## 📌 Requirements

- A clean installation of **Microsoft Office 365** (any recent version)

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- ❗ *"Activation failed?"*  
  → Make sure you're using a supported Office build and ran the tool as Administrator

- ❗ *"Tool closes immediately?"*  
  → Your antivirus may be blocking the script — whitelist the file temporarily

  → Use the included `License Fixer` in the `Tools/` folder
